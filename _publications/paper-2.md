The concept of SOEKS and DDNA is to capture, store, organise, and re-use formal decisions in a knowledgeexplicit form to help in decision-making. In this study, we review past works and advancements in the concepts of Decisional DNA (DDNA) and Set of Experience Knowledge Structure (SOEKS) since the birth of the original concept. Firstly, the original concept of SOEKS and DDNA, a comparison with human DNA and the construction of DDNA are discussed. In the second part, advancements of DDNA are investigated in chronological order. Lastly, the application and limitation of DDNA are discussed. Finally, the possible future advancements of DDNA are suggested.
